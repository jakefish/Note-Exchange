# Note-Exchange

Final Site
Submit all of the content in a zip archive for your personal project site we have been working on.

Verify the following items are met:

1) Consistent file names (i.e. page-one.html and page2.html are not consistent)

2) all images should have alt and title attributes for accessibility (make sure the URLs don't include "localhost" addresses)

3) the content structure (i.e. folders for CSS, images, etc.) should not be flat (i.e. all in one folder)

4) At least one font used should be an embedded font

5) at least 8 content pages, unless you are doing some server-side programming that utilizes a database or other data source

6) No typos.

7) Proper semantic use of HTML (i.e. no tables for layout purposes other than tabular data)

8) Visually cohesive colors (plenty of sites online provide color themes that should assist you in this)

9) Navigation must be present on all pages, but you don't necessarily need to access every page from every other page (for instance, hierarchical navigation).

10) It must display equivalently across modern browsers (not pixel perfect, but definitely to the point that there is no obvious difference)... Modern browsers are defined as IE 9 and higher, Firefox, and Chrome. (Safari if you are on a Mac, but I will be testing it from Windows).

12) Must challenge your individual skills (this will be defined individually with me during the process of refining your site)

13) No inline CSS, only CSS in external style sheets unless you want an item to initially load with display:none and then later show by way of JavaScript

14) CSS must have a minimum of 10 element or ID based rules and 5 classes

15) Images should be sized appropriately (i.e. no constraining of image height/width unless you have a specific need (responsive design or used in lightbox scenario)

16) There are some subjective points that will be allocated based on the aesthetic qualities of the site (~20%)

17) bonus consideration will be provided to students doing server-side coding (i.e. PHP, ASP.NET, Java) and database interaction. The bonus means that there is some leeway for not having as much polish for the rest of the site due to the additional work involved.  Clear this with me if you are interested.

50 of the 150 points will come from your weekly progress updates, do not miss them.
